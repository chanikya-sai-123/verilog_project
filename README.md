# verilog_project
I have generated a controller model that synchronizes the CPU requests with SRAM operations by generating accurate control signals aligning with the requirments. An FSM has been inserted inorder to make the procedure smooth



This repository contains a Verilog HDL project with a top-level design module,
three dependent sub-modules, and a testbench for functional verification.

## Files Included
- design_top.v
- module1.v
- module2.v
- testbench.v

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Vivado

## How to Run
1. Compile all design files and the testbench.
2. Run the simulation.
3. Observe waveforms and output.
