# verilog_project
I have generated a processor model that computes opeartion requires for the execution of assembly instructiosn such as jumo, Branch and arithmetic operations using the methodologies used in the pipelining like Forwarding of data to increase frequency.


This repository contains a Verilog HDL project with a top-level design module,
three dependent sub-modules, and a testbench for functional verification.

## Files Included
- design_top.v
- module1.v
- module2.v
- module3.v
- testbench.v

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Vivado

## How to Run
1. Compile all design files and the testbench.
2. Run the simulation.
3. Observe waveforms and output.
